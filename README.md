# Voice Emotion Detection

This project implements a Voice Emotion Detection system using machine learning techniques. It includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for real-time emotion recognition and a machine learning model trained on the Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS) dataset.

## Files

- `gui.py`: Python script containing the GUI for real-time emotion detection.
- `model_creation.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for creating and training the emotion detection model.
  
## Instructions

1. Run the `gui.py` script to launch the GUI for real-time emotion detection.
2. Ensure the model files (`best_model.json` and `best_model1.h5`) are present in the root directory.

## Real-time Emotion Detection

- Click the "Upload Voice File" button to select an audio file for emotion detection.
- Click the "Start Recording" button to record your voice and get real-time emotion predictions.

## Model

The emotion detection model is trained on the Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS) dataset. For details on the model architecture and training process, refer to `model_creation.ipynb`.

## Dataset

The training dataset used for this project is the Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS). You can find the TESS dataset [here]([provide_dataset_link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ejlok1/toronto-emotional-speech-set-tess)).
